        <p> Do people really drink the swill sold at Tully's and SBC? STARBUCKS??? Gag.</p>
        <h3> And for that matter, every drop of coffee i had in Europe was Robusta-
          I was under the illusion of believing that they were the true
          coffee snobs of the world- that there i would find the finely roasted
          perfection i had always dreamed of finding. Alas, no- there was only
          sludge produced by, i can only imagine, compost. The search continues
          for the ultimate Bravado boosting beverage. </h3>
